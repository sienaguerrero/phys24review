Physics 24, "Mechanics \& Wave Motion" is a core class at Harvey Mudd College. \hfill \par \noindent 
From the HMC Physic's site:

\begin{quote} 
\say{Classical mechanics is introduced beginning with inertial frames and the Galilean transformation, followed by momentum and momentum conservation in collisions, Newtonâ€™s laws of motion, spring forces, gravitational forces, and friction. Differential and integral calculus are used extensively throughout. Work, kinetic energy and potential energy are defined, and energy conservation is discussed in particle motion and collisions. Rotational motion is treated, including angular momentum, torque, cross-products, and statics. Other topics include rotating frames, pseudoforces, and central-force motion. Simple harmonic and some nonlinear oscillations are discussed, followed by waves on strings, sound, and other types of waves, and wave phenomena such as standing waves, beats, two-slit interference, resonance, and the Doppler effect.}

This document attempts to list some of the basic concepts for this course to aid in studying for the final exam.
