Review for PHYS24 "Mechanics &amp; Wavemotion" at Harvey Mudd College.
This repository contains a study guide written on Overleaf with LaTeX using a combination of lecture notes, cover sheets, and more!

In this document, I hope to cover the basic topics covered in this course including basic definitions, equations, and problem-solving methods. 

Special thanks to my recitation professor, Prof Shuve, as well as all the other physics professors and tutors who've helped me along the way.
